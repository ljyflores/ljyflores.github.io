* Graph Neural Networks (Graph2Seq) for Table Question Answering [<a href="https://github.com/ljyflores/graph4nlp">Code</a>, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PjdIz9slb8reKmpFhyyidpHs1zZRxVGH/view?usp=sharing">Writeup</a>]
  * Proposed a new method for table-based question answering tasks that represents tables using graphs, implemented with the Graph4NLP package; developed methods to test the robustness of these embeddings to perturbations in the input

* Debiasing Clinical Summaries of Race for Downstream Treatment Prediction [<a href="https://github.com/ljyflores/debiasing-clinical-summaries">Code</a>, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zgGBQSmc1mVJHEZQMTeuETzEEOHrwuQW/view">Writeup</a>]
  * Proposed and implemented GANs, weighting, and heuristics methods to debias clinical summaries for treatment prediction 

* Improving Fake News Classification with Distributionally Robust Optimization [<a href="https://github.com/ljyflores/distributionally-robust-fake-news-classification">Code</a>, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oZH67nraRTS5kXUM_nrTc0JiyF4bWEwI/view?usp=sharing">Writeup</a>]
  * Adapted robust optimization algorithm (Sagawa et al., 2020) to improve fake news model’s worst-case performance

* Markov Switching Models for Stock Price Prediction [<a href="https://github.com/ljyflores/bayes-for-markov-switching">Code</a>, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nfoNjcJfUpudIiWJt5PEUaczfERx-7gk/view">Writeup</a>]
  * Implemented Markov Switching model using Bayesian inference (Gibbs Sampling) by Lim et al (2020), and compared it to standard maximum likelihood approaches
