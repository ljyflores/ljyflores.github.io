And thanks for stopping by! I am Lj Flores, a data scientist at QuantumBlack (AI by McKinsey). I also collaborate with Prof. Arman Cohan and Dr. Sophie Chheang on various NLP tasks in the medical domain, with the goal of reducing hallucination. 

Previously, I completed my bachelors and masters in statistics at Yale University, where I got to work with Prof. Dragomir Radev and Linyong Nan (LILY Lab) on NLP tasks over tabular data. Outside, I've also gotten to collaborate with Dr. Leo Celi (MIT Critical Data) on NLP tasks in the medical domain.

I am deeply interested in natural language processing, particularly with regards to generation tasks (e.g. summarization, simplification), and machine learning broadly applied for social good (especially in the Philippines)!
