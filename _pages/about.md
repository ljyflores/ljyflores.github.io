And thank you for stopping by! I am Lj Flores, a data scientist at QuantumBlack (AI by McKinsey). I also collaborate with Prof. Arman Cohan on projects in summarization and simplification. 

I completed a joint bachelors and masters in statistics at Yale University, where I got to work with Prof. Dragomir Radev and Linyong Nan (LILY Lab) on NLP tasks over tabular data.

I am deeply interested in natural language processing, particularly with regards to generation tasks (e.g. summarization, simplification), and machine learning broadly applied for social good (especially in the Philippines)!
